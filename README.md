# 🧪 Amazon TDD Automation Testing Project

This is a self-practice project that follows the **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach to automate testing of core functionalities in an e-commerce website modeled after Amazon. The project is built using **Java**, **Selenium WebDriver**, and **JUnit**, with a focus on writing tests first and driving development from them.

## 🎯 Objective

To practice TDD in test automation by writing failing tests first, implementing the minimum code to pass them, and then refactoring. This improves test reliability, code quality, and confidence in automation workflows.
